# This is a simple Nix expression for a package that fetches a tarball,
# builds it, and installs the binary into the output directory.
}
# The package is named "hello-world" and has a version of "1.0".          

# The source is fetched from a specified URL, and the SHA256 hash is provided
# to ensure integrity. The install phase creates a directory for the binary
# and copies the executable into it. The metadata includes a description,
# homepage, license, maintainers, and supported platforms.
# The passthru attribute allows access to the package name and version
# outside of the derivation, which can be useful for other Nix expressions
# or scripts that might depend on this package.
# This expression can be used in a Nix environment to build and install
# the "hello-world" package, making it available for use in the system.
# The package is designed to be simple and straightforward, serving as an
# example of how to create a Nix package with basic attributes and functionality.
# It can be extended or modified to include additional features or dependencies
# as needed for more complex applications.
# This code snippet is a complete Nix expression for a simple package named "hello-world".
